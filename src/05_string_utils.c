/* General Notes 5.1 & 5.2 
 * 5.1 - Representations of Strings
 *
 * One of the major common pitfalls of using strings is messing up the way
 * multibyte characters fit into fixed-width buffers. When many of the string
 * utilities in this section were written, ASCII characters were the characters
 * considered, not UTF-8. This means that they consider all characters to be
 * 1-byte length characters, when in reality UTF-8 characters can be up to 4
 * bytes in length.
 *
 * Obviously if you are not careful when uting UTF-8 character encoding with
 * legacy string utilities it is very much a possibility that you could exceed
 * buffer lengths on read or write operations 
 *
 * The problem is wchar_t isn't really fixed-width, because on AIT and windows
 * machines wchar_t is 16-bit and can't accomodate all of the unicode
 * characters. So they're either limited to UCS-2, or they suddenly have a
 * multi-byte problem like before.
 *
 * To solve this we use libunistring which has solved these problems
 *
 * 5.2 - Strings and Array conventions 
 *
 * in libc, functions that operate on arbitrary blocks of memory start with mem
 * or wmem (such as memcpy) and these invariably take arguments specifying size
 * in bytes (or wide characters, which are fixed-width regardless of encoding
 * standard. They can operate on any kind of pointer and get the correct size
 * to them using sizeof, but wmem are specially reserved for (wchar_t *)
 * pointer types and are not really usable with anything but arrays of this
 * type 
 *
 * If the function starts with str or wcs (e.g. strcpy or wcscpy) then they
 * look for null-termination to figure out size. 
 *
 * IF THE SIZE IS KNOWN, USE MEM FUNCTIONS TO REDUCE EDGE CASE BUGS 
 *
 * Alternatively you could look into a UTF standard library like libunistring 
 *      I installed this with 'sudo apt install libunistring-dev'

 *      be rewritten to take advantage of already calculated results.  Again: it

/* Section 5.6 Notes 
 * Truncation is just as spicy as concatenation, and for good reason:
 *      "Because these functions can abruptly truncate strings or wide
 *      strings, they are generally poor choices for processing text.  When
 *      coping or concatening multibyte strings, they can truncate within a
 *      multibyte character so that the result is not a valid multibyte string.
 *      When combining or concatenating multibyte or wide strings, they may
 *      truncate the output after a combining character, resulting in a
 *      corrupted grapheme.  They can cause bugs even when processing
 *      single-byte strings: for example, when calculating an ASCII-only user
 *      name, a truncated name can identify the wrong user."
 *
 * The manual suggests using instead -fcheck-pointer-bounds and
 * -fsanitize=address options with gcc to debug instead of truncating strings.
 *
 * This makes sense, because you'll just roll yourself into new bugs since
 * strncpy doesn't do null termination and things like strndup which do add a
 * null terminator can stull truncate a unicode character into something
 * nonsensical.
 *
 * GNU Coding Standards suggest just using dynamic memory allocation carefully
 * and never truncating for buffer length.
